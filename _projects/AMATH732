## Final Oral Presentation

The oral presentation examined the normal modes of \(N\) coupled oscillators.  
It introduced the governing equations, described a general procedure for obtaining normal mode frequencies, and illustrated the case of four coupled oscillators with explicit mode shapes.  

The analysis showed that the spectrum can be derived directly from the tridiagonal coupling matrix, and that the resulting frequencies follow a predictable spacing pattern controlled by the coupling strength and boundary conditions.
