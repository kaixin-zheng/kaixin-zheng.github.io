## Course Description
This course introduces Biological and clinical aspects of cancer. Overview of recent mathematical models developed to examine different stages of cancer growth and therapeutic strategies, including ordinary and partial differential equation models, discrete models and models based on continuum mechanics. Various analytical and numerical methods will be used in the analysis of these models.

## Course Project
In my [course project](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.05.04.592529v1), I developed a comprehensive model to differentiate spontaneous, drug-induced, and CSCs-related drug resistance. The findings demonstrate that, at equivalent cumulative dosages, bolus injection markedly extends patient survival. Furthermore, a potentially bimodal relationship emerges between bolus injection efficacy and maximum dosage, suggesting that two optimal bolus injection strategies may hold.
